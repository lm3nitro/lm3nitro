I grew up playing chess my whole life. Playing chess allowed me to network with many people and made it so that I was able to meet someone that introduced me to networking at the age of 14. I have had a passion for networking and seeing how IP communicates ever since. Growing up, I was always very curious to see how things work. I have since spent tons of hours trying to reverse engineer how things work and why they are important and used. I love analyzing network traffic at the deepest level in hex. My love for Networking has also fueled my passion for Security. 

In my most recent role, I was a Network Engineer. I am currently seeking to leverage my expertise in networking and expand into the dynamic field of cybersecurity. My journey encompasses a diverse range of projects and experiences, where I have honed my skills in areas such as virtualization, proxy technologies, firewall configuration, IDS/IPS implementations, SIEM integration, and more.

I am fueled by a deep passion for cybersecurity, driven by the ever-evolving landscape of digital threats and the imperative to safeguard critical assets and data. My enthusiasm extends beyond professional obligations, as I am constantly exploring new techniques, tools, and methodologies to enhance security posture and stay ahead of emerging threats.

I thrive on continuous learning, actively engaging in industry forums, training programs, and certifications. This commitment to ongoing education empowers me to adapt to evolving security challenges and implement best practices that align with industry standards and regulations.

I am personally drawn to challenges that push boundaries and inspire innovative solutions. I embrace challenges as opportunities for growth and look for ways to contribute to the cybersecurity community.
